%changelog
* Mon Jul 29 2002 Patrick Patterson <ppatters@nit.ca>
- Synchronise with Upstream

* Wed Feb 27 2002 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
- merge the main and -devel packages into one .spec file
- use globbing to shorten the file lists
- don't define name, version, and release as macros (RPM does this by default)
- use the License: tag instead of Copyright: (equivalent at the package level,
  but License: reflects the intent of the tag better)
- use a URL to point to the source of the source tarball
- add BuildRequires: openssl-devel (libwvcrypto uses libcrypto)
- move the buildroot to be under %%{_tmppath}, so that it can be moved by
  altering RPM's configuration

* Tue Jan 29 2002 Patrick Patterson <ppatters@nit.ca>
- Initial Release of WvStreams

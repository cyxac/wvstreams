 * wvfork() just runs fork(), but it closes all file descriptors that
 * are flagged close-on-exec, since we don't necessarily always run
 * exec() after we fork()...
 *
 * This fixes the year-old mystery bug where WvTapeBackup caused
 * watchdog reboots because the CHILD process wasn't touching it, and
 * it was already open before the fork()...
 *
 * If you want to explicitly leave a file descriptor OPEN, even if
 * it's marked close-on-exec, then add the fd number to dontclose, and
 * pass that to wvfork().  This is mainly useful for WvLoopbacks --
 * you may want certain ones open or closed depending on which call to
 * wvfork() you're making.  (for WvTapeBackup, you want the three
 * backup loopbacks open, and, say, any WvResolver loopbacks closed.)

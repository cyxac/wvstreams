Package: libwvstreams4.0
Architecture: all
Section: libs
Depends: libwvstreams4.0-base
Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 WvStreams is a library suite that is comprised of several parts.  Included
 in the base package are:
  * WvString: a convenient and efficient C++ string class
  * WvList: an easy-to-use linked list
  * WvHashTable: an efficient and easy-to-use hash table
  * WvFile: a WvStream wrapper for handling files
  * WvStreamClone: a base class which makes writing your own WvStreams easy
  * WvLog: a log files handler 
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on libwvstreams4.0-base.

Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 WvStreams is a library suite that is comprised of several parts.  Among 
 them are:
  * WvIPStreams: which includes WvTCPStream and WvUDPStream
  * WvCrypto streams: a REALLY easy way to add SSL support to applications 
 .
 These are the base classes used to build programs such as the ever popular 
 WvDial, TunnelVision, FastForward, KWvDial, retchmail, and many more yet 
 to come.  ;)

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Provides: libuniconf
Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 UniConf is a configuration system that can serve as the centrepiece among
 many other, existing configuration systems, such as:
  * GConf
  * KConfig
  * Windows registry
  * Mutt ;)
 .
 UniConf can also be accessed over the network, with authentication, allowing
 easy replication of configuration data via the UniReplicateGen.

Description: Development libraries and header files for libwvstreams4.0
 Contains the header files and static libraries for use in rapid 
 application development using the WvStreams set of libraries.  It 
 includes everything that is needed to compile a program that needs 
 WvStreams.
 .
 The WvStreams library suite is a set of C++ network libraries that
 make it fast and simple to develop network applications.

Package: libwvstreams4.0-doc
Architecture: all
Section: doc
Suggests: libwvstreams4.0 (= ${Source-Version}), libwvstreams4.0-dev (= ${Source-Version})
Description: Documentation for WvStreams
 Contains all the documentation available to program with WvStreams.
  .

 make it fast and simple to develop network applications.

Package: libwvstreams4.0-fft
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: WvStreams wrapper for libfftw
 This package contains the library necessary for the WvStreams to libfftw
 wrapper. It enables WvStreams programs to easily handle Fast-Fourier
 transforms, instead of forcing the programmer to use the much harder to use
 libfftw interface.

Package: libwvstreams4.0-speex
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: WvStreams Speex Encoder/Decoder Library
 This library contains the WvSpeexEncoder and WvSpexxDecoder to enable quick 
 and painless creation of audio streams using the Speex Voice over IP CODEC

Package: libwvstreams4.0-qt
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: WvStreams and Qt Event Integration Library
 This package contains the library necessary to tie WvStreams and Qt program
 event loops together to enable WvStreams to act as the I/O and configuration
 back end for Qt and KDE.

Package: libwvstreams4.0-vorbis
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: WvStreams OggVorbis Encoder/Decoder Library
 This library contains the WvOggEncoder and WvOggDecoder to enable quick and
 painless creation of audio streams using the OggVorbis CODEC
